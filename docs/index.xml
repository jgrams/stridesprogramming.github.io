      <title>Creating Responsive iFrames</title>

      <description>The Problem Whenever you pull some iFrame code from a 3rd party site (like YouTube or Bandcamp) to embed on your site, it will have an inline height and width defined in pixels.
&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;560&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;315&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
This is because iFrames are like little windows into another site and need to have a defined size so that everything that site wants to display in its iFrame will be visible.
If you want your iFrame to fill 100% of its allotted space, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to make the width &amp;ldquo;100%&amp;rdquo; because its height won&amp;rsquo;t follow suit.</description>

      <description>Orienting for Speed Hugo is a way to write an HTML website using the Go programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s nice, because you use lots of HTML and a little Go. The fastest way to build a custom Hugo site is starting your own theme.
Command Line, Activate Theme Open your terminal, check your installation and version of Hugo, and let&amp;rsquo;s run some commands. You can rename the last word of these, they use silly placeholder names.</description>

      <description>Taking Inventory Do you know how to use the terminal? If you don&amp;rsquo;t, start here.
The first step in the installation process is noting what software is already installed. I&amp;rsquo;m running Linux (an operating system, specifically Ubuntu 18.04) and have Hugo (0.74.3) installed. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Hugo, follow their installation instructions. With Hugo installed, run hugo new site best-website in the terminal.
  Lookup Operating System Version, Lookup Hugo Version, Create Hugo New Site</description>
